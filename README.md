### Environment Variable Bindings Across Images

Additionally, a user can create cross-image environment variable bindings by making a reference to another image’s environment variable. In this case, we have made several bindings – including database_url=jdbc:mysql://{{MySQL|container_ip}}:3306/{{MySQL|MYSQL_DATABASE}} – in which the database container IP is resolved dynamically at request time and is used to ensure that the application servers can establish a connection with the database.

Here is a list of supported environment variable values:

-   **{{alphanumeric | 8}}** – creates a random 8-character alphanumeric string. This is most useful for creating random passwords.

-   **{{Image Name | ip}}** – allows you to enter the host IP address of a container as a value for an environment variable. This is most useful for allowing the middleware tier to establish a connection with the database.

-   **{{Image Name | container_ip}}** – allows you to enter the name of a container as a value for an environment variable. This is most useful for allowing the middleware tier to establish a secure connection with the database (without exposing the database port).

-   **{{Image Name | container_private_ip}}** – allows you to enter the internal IP of a container as a value for an environment variable. This is most useful for allowing the middleware tier to establish a secure connection with the database (without exposing the database port).

-   **{{Image Name | port_Port Number}}** – allows you to enter the Port number of a container as a value for an environment variable. This is most useful for allowing the middleware tier to establish a connection with the database. In this case, the port number specified needs to be the internal port number – i.e. not the external port that is allocated to the container. For example, {{PostgreSQL | port_5432}} will be translated to the actual external port that will allow the middleware tier to establish a connection with the database.

-   **{{Image Name | Environment Variable Name}}** – allows you to enter the value an image’s environment variable into another image’s environment variable. The use cases here are endless – as most multi-tier applications will have cross-image dependencies.
